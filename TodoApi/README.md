### TODOs API

## Purpose
  Create a sample TODO API for TODOs CURD. It can be used to serve the Frontend code.

## Tech used
  # Nodejs,
  # Expression
  # Typescript
  # MongoDB


## To be added

To make it cleaner, we can add dependency injection to class.
At this moment for sample task like todo, it would be fine without Dependency injection(Over engineering maybe???)

We can also add validator middleware prior request

## To start

```
npm install
```

then
```
npm dev
```
