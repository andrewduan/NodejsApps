### TODOs API

## Purpose
  Create a sample TODO API for TODOs CURD. It can be used to serve the Frontend code.

## Tech used
  Nodejs,
  Expression
  Typescript
  MongoDB & Mongoose


## To be added

1. Unit tests

2. To make it cleaner, we can add dependency injection to class.
At this moment for sample task like todo, it would be fine without Dependency injection(Over engineering maybe???)

3. We can also add validator middleware prior request

4. We can also introduce Docker

## To start

```
npm install
```

then
```
npm dev
```
